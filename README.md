Add to your project contents in unity. 
Go to Tools>Set Terrain Tree Obstacles then click the "bake" button in the new editor window.
If your terrain is setup with terrain trees it will bake a "Tree_Obstacles" object with all the NavMesh Obstacles
NOTE: this does NOT add terrain tree colliders (make sure the prefab you are using has a capsule collider around the tree trunk)
